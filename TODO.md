## TODO

- ECS Cluster with consul agents and registrator
- Documentation on examples for registering services to the cluster
- DNS working with Route53 and BIND
- Potentially use ASG for the servers with cloud-init scripts injected via user-data
- Terraform ECS cluster, and Route53 (and any other infrastructure) in a sub-module
- Separate the server and clients in different sub-modules
